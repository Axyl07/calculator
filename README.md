# Calculator

This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project provides basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as clear and delete functionality. The calculator mimics a real-life calculator, handling inputs dynamically and displaying results instantly.

## Features

- **Basic Mathematical Operations**: Perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Screen (AC)**: Clear all the input values and reset the calculator.
- **Delete (DEL)**: Delete the last entered value.
- **Real-time Input Display**: Displays the current input and result in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator adjusts to different screen sizes and is mobile-friendly.

## Project Structure

```plaintext

├── index.html          # HTML file that structures the calculator.
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling the calculator.
└── script.js           # JavaScript file for handling calculator logic.
```

### `index.html`

This file provides the basic structure of the calculator interface. It contains the buttons for digits, operators, and functions, and a display section to show the inputs and results.

### `style.css`

This file contains the styles for the calculator. It includes layouts, colors, fonts, and responsive adjustments to ensure the calculator looks good across various devices.

### `script.js`

The core logic of the calculator is written in this file. It listens to the button inputs, performs the calculations, updates the display, and handles edge cases (like dividing by zero or managing multiple operators).

## Usage

To use this calculator:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Axyl07/calculator.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**:  
   Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

   ```bash
   cd calculator
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Start Calculating**:  
   You can now use the calculator in your browser for basic mathematical operations.

## Functionalities

The calculator supports the following operations:

1. **Addition**: Adds two or more numbers.  
   Example: `3 + 2 = 5`
   
2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.  
   Example: `8 - 5 = 3`
   
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two or more numbers.  
   Example: `4 * 7 = 28`
   
4. **Division**: Divides one number by another.  
   Example: `10 / 2 = 5`
   
5. **Clear (AC)**: Clears all the input and resets the calculator.  
   Example: Pressing AC will reset everything.

6. **Delete (DEL)**: Deletes the last input character.  
   Example: If you input `123`, pressing `DEL` will remove the last digit, leaving you with `12`.
